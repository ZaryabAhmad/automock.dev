# Mocks and Stubs: The Fundamentals of Automock

In the realm of unit testing, the terms "mock" and "stub" are frequently used, often interchangeably. However, they
serve distinct purposes and understanding their nuances is crucial for effective testing. This guide delves into the
definitions and usage of mocks and stubs, with examples from both Jest and Sinon.

As Automock relies on Martin Fowler's Solitary Unit Tests, we also draw inspiration from his articles, like
"Mocks Aren't Stubs". In this article, Fowler distinguishes between the terms "mock" and "stub," clarifying their roles
in unit testing.

## What is a Stub?

A stub is a function/property that controls a method's behavior in a test. It replaces the targeted function's behavior
with custom behavior for testing purposes. Let's see an example both for Jest and for Sinon.

```typescript
const stub = jest.fn();


```


## What is a Mock?

A mock is an object that simulates the behavior of a real object in controlled ways. It's essentially a set of method
stubs with pre-programmed behavior, as well as pre-programmed expectations. Mocks are used in unit tests to mimic real
objects, providing the expected behavior without invoking the actual underlying code.

In the context of Automock, a mock is a collection of stubs.
