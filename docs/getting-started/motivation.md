### Automock Principles: What Drives Us

‚ú® **Boosting Productivity** - Our goal is to spare developers precious time and energy by automating the intricate
process of creating mock objects. This abolishes the necessity for manual mock setup, cutting down on boilerplate code
and freeing you to focus on crafting insightful test cases while elevating the caliber of your codebase.

:rocket: **Embracing Simplicity** - Automock boasts an intuitive and user-friendly API, making it accessible to
developers of all proficiency levels. By automating the creation of mock objects, Automock streamlines the testing
procedure, simplifying complexity and making unit testing more accessible than ever.

üîß **Upholding Maintainability** - Championing code maintainability, the generated mocks retain the same type
information as authentic objects. This ensures type safety and harnesses TypeScript's potent static type checking
capabilities. This approach bolsters code readability, curtails error risks, and facilitates smoother code refactoring
and upkeep over time.

üìê **Consistency in Syntax and Test Architecture** - Encouraging uniformity in test syntax and structure, Automock
champions a consistent and coherent approach to your unit tests. By adhering to established conventions and guidelines,
you can set the stage for a standardized method of crafting tests.
